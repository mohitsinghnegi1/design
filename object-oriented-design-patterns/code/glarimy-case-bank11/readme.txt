ZERO
Starting point

ONE
01. Class names and interface names must be in camel case with first letter in capitals
02. Class names, interface names and attribute names are expected to be nouns
03. Attribute names and method names must be in camelCase
04. Static attributes & methods must be in ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORE
05. Method names are expected to be command-verbs
06. Names must be meaningful and readable

TWO
07. Classes with functionality (service classes) must have interfaces.
08. Avoid multiple parameters to methods, wherever possible.
09. Follow bean standards
10. Validate the input
11. Consider failures with proper exceptions
12. Code against the interfaces

THREE
13. Have proper packaging structure (api, service, client, domain, exceptions)

FOUR
14. Go for loose-coupling
15. Use factory to create service objects
16. Convert appropriate objects into singletons

FIVE
17. Use proxies for pluggable features
18. Build a chain of responsibilities for conditional escalation

SIX
19. Use an adapter as a protection layer while integrating with third-party code

SEVEN
20. Offer decorators for optional/additional features

EIGHT
21. User observer for notifying events to the listening objects asynchronously

NINE
22. Accept logic from clients as lamba expressions

TEN
23. Avoid creating custom functional interfaces

ELEVEN
24. Use stream-programming API for processing the collections
